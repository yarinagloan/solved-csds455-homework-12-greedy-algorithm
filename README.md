The next subject we will cover is graph coloring for general graphs. For your reading this weekend, take a look at Brook’s Theorem and look up the <em>greedy algorithm </em>for coloring a graph.

<strong>Problem 1</strong>: Show that every graph <em>G </em>has a vertex ordering for which the greedy algorithm uses only <em>χ</em>(<em>G</em>) colors.

<strong>Problem 2</strong>: For every <em>n&gt; </em>1, find a bipartite graph on 2<em>n </em>vertices, ordered in such a way that the greedy algorithm uses <em>n </em>rather than 2 colors.

<strong>Problem 3</strong>: A <em>k </em>chromatic graph is called <em>critically k-chromatic</em>, or just <em>critical</em>, if <em>χ</em>(<em>G</em>−<em>v</em>) <em>&lt;k </em>for every <em>v </em>∈ <em>V </em>(<em>G</em>). Show that every <em>k</em>-chromatic graph has a critical <em>k</em>-chromatic induced subgraph and that any such subgraph has minimum degree at least <em>k</em>− 1.

<strong>Problem 4</strong>: Let ∆(<em>G</em>) be the maximum degree of <em>G</em>. Prove that for any ∆ ≥ 4, there exists a graph <em>G </em>with <em>χ</em>(<em>G</em>) ≥ ∆(<em>G</em>) − 1 but <em>G </em>does not contain a ∆(<em>G</em>) − 1 clique.
